**Implementing Naive Bayes from scratch using Spark**

Spark is one if the most popular cluster computing framework. This project is part of my learning in understanding how Spark works efficiently and faster with large datasets. Further, I use this as an opportunity to implement a simple Machine Learning algorithm from scratch - Naive Bayes.

Naive Bayes is used here for binary sentiment classification on the popular movie reviews data which can be found here -

The dataset contains 25,000 movie reviews for training and an additional 25,000 for testing.
